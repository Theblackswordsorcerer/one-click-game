Project: “Dungeon Escape: The Python Lair” — A Pure Python Text Adventure Game 

This is a complete, self-contained, turn-based RPG-style game built entirely in Python — no external libraries, no pip installs, no setup required. You just run it, and you’re dropped into a dark dungeon as a hero trying to escape the lair of the Python King. The game features combat with multiple enemies (spiders, skeletons, guards, and a final boss), an inventory system (potions, keys, weapons), leveling mechanics (gain XP, level up stats), traps, room exploration, and multiple endings. The code is structured with clear OOP principles: a Player class handles your stats and actions, an Enemy class defines foes, and helper functions manage combat, room transitions, and UI (using print, input, os.system, and time.sleep for pacing). Everything from the ASCII title screen to the win/lose conditions is handled in one file — making it perfect for learning, showcasing, or just having fun. It’s designed to be easy to read, modify, and expand — whether you want to add more rooms, items, or even save/load functionality later. This isn’t just a game — it’s a fully playable demonstration of how powerful and fun pure Python can be.
